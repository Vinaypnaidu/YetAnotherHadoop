# Yet Another Hadoop

Yet Another Hadoop or YAH is a mini-HDFS setup on your system, complete with the architectural structure consisting of Data Nodes and Name Nodes and replication of data across nodes, as a part of the UE19CS322 Big Data course Project at PES University.

With YAH, you will possess finer control over your data blocks and their replication, and allow you to create a distributed file system as per your needs. YAH also allows running Hadoop like jobs to break down computationally heavy tasks into smaller distributed tasks.


## Software/Languages to be used:

### Creating the HDFS 
This process initialises the distributed file system. Datanode folders, datanode code files, namenode and secondary namenode files, metadata files get created.
`python3 createhdfs.py`
